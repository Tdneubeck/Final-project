      <h1>Rules of Baseball</h1>
      <p>Baseball is played by two teams of 9 players each who try to score more runs than their opponent by rounding the bases and crossing home plate as many times as possible. 
The batting team stays up to bat until the fielding team puts out 3 batters.
The visiting team bats first while the home team starts out in the field on defense. Each fielder lines up in one of the 9 fielding positions. The first batter steps into the batter's box and prepares to hit the pitch.
There is a batter's box on both sides of home plate. The batter may choose which side of the plate to hit from, but both of his feet must be inside the box.</p>
      <p>He attempts to score runs by hitting the ball when it's pitched to him. The batter may continue to hit until he: <ul> <li>hits the ball in fair territory</li> <li>gets 3 <b>strikes</b></li><li>gets 4 <b>balls</b></li></ul></p>
      <p>The strike zone is the area between the batter's shoulders and knees. A "strike" is called by the umpire when the batter:<ul><li> fails to swing at a pitch that crosses the plate in the strike zone.</li><li>swings at a pitch and misses.</li><li>hits the ball out of bounds with fewer than two strikes against him.</li></ul></p>
      <p>Once he gets 3 strikes he is out, and the next batter comes up to the plate.
A batter can't strike out on a foul ball. If he has two strikes, there's no limit to the number of foul balls he is allowed to hit. He can only strike out on a swing and miss or a ball he fails to swing at in the strike zone.
The teams take turns going back and forth 7 or 9 times. Theses are called <b>innings</b></p>
